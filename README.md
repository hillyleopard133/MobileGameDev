4th year mobile game development assignments

Files are in master branch.

The game can be run using the APK file in the releases folder.



**Build Steps**

Switch Unity build platform to Android.

In player settings -> other settings set the scripting backend to IL2CPP and the target architecture to ARM64.

In build profiles tick Development build and Autoconnect Profiler.

I don't have access to an Android phone so I used an emulator in Android studio.

Build the project APK and run it on the emulator.

**Known Issues**

None
